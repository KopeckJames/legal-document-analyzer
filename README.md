   - Interactive dashboards for analytics
   - Knowledge repository interface

2. **Backend Layer (Flask)**
   - RESTful API for all operations
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Document management services
   - Analytics services

3. **Data Pipeline**
   - Document processing pipeline
   - ETL processes for data transformation
   - Data quality and validation

4. **Machine Learning Layer**
   - Document classification
   - Entity extraction
   - Predictive analytics
   - Recommendation engine

5. **Database Layer (PostgreSQL)**
   - Structured storage for all system data
   - Optimized for analytical queries

## Core Technologies

- **Python Flask** backend with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Advanced AI** document analysis powered by machine learning
- **RESTful API** for third-party integrations
- **OpenAI** integration for intelligent document processing
- **PostgreSQL** for robust data management

## Features
